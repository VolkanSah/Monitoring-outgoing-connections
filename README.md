# Monitoring outgoing connections 
can be a useful approach to detect potential network activity like ransomware, spyware or trojan 

Keep in mind that this script will show all outgoing TCP connections, not just those related to ransomware. It can help you identify suspicious or unexpected connections that may require further investigation. It's important to analyze the logged information and take appropriate action based on your findings.

```python
import psutil
import socket
import time

def monitor_outgoing_connections():
    while True:
        connections = psutil.net_connections(kind='tcp')
        for conn in connections:
            if conn.status == 'ESTABLISHED' and conn.raddr:
                remote_address = f"{conn.raddr[0]}:{conn.raddr[1]}"
                local_address = f"{conn.laddr[0]}:{conn.laddr[1]}"
                process_name = psutil.Process(conn.pid).name()

                # Log the outgoing connection
                log_message = f"Outgoing connection detected:\nProcess: {process_name}\nLocal Address: {local_address}\nRemote Address: {remote_address}\n"
                print(log_message)
                # You can also write the log message to a file for further analysis

        time.sleep(1)

# Start monitor outgoing connections
monitor_outgoing_connections()
```

- Run the script with appropriate permissions and ensure that the required libraries (psutil) are installed!

- Please note that this script is a starting point and may need customization based on your specific requirements and environment. It's recommended to consult with cybersecurity professionals and consider integrating this monitoring mechanism into a comprehensive security solution.
