Monitoring outgoing connections can be a useful approach to detect potential ransomware activity. 
Here's an example Python script that demonstrates how you can track and log outgoing connections:
```python
import psutil
import socket
import time

def monitor_outgoing_connections():
    while True:
        connections = psutil.net_connections(kind='tcp')
        for conn in connections:
            if conn.status == 'ESTABLISHED' and conn.raddr:
                remote_address = f"{conn.raddr[0]}:{conn.raddr[1]}"
                local_address = f"{conn.laddr[0]}:{conn.laddr[1]}"
                process_name = psutil.Process(conn.pid).name()

                # Log the outgoing connection
                log_message = f"Outgoing connection detected:\nProcess: {process_name}\nLocal Address: {local_address}\nRemote Address: {remote_address}\n"
                print(log_message)
                # You can also write the log message to a file for further analysis

        time.sleep(1)

# Start monitoring outgoing connections
monitor_outgoing_connections()
```

This script uses the psutil library to retrieve information about active network connections. It continuously monitors established TCP connections and logs the details of outgoing connections, including the process name, local address, and remote address.

Keep in mind that this script will show all outgoing TCP connections, not just those related to ransomware. It can help you identify suspicious or unexpected connections that may require further investigation. It's important to analyze the logged information and take appropriate action based on your findings.

Remember to run the script with appropriate permissions and ensure that the required libraries (psutil) are installed.

Please note that this script is a starting point and may need customization based on your specific requirements and environment. It's recommended to consult with cybersecurity professionals and consider integrating this monitoring mechanism into a comprehensive security solution.

Additionally, please ensure that you comply with legal and ethical guidelines when monitoring network connections and respect privacy considerations.
